# Margin Disparity Discrepancy

## Prerequisites:

* Python3
* PyTorch ==0.3.1 (with suitable CUDA and CuDNN version)
* torchvision == 0.2.0
* Numpy
* argparse
* PIL
* tqdm
* pyyaml
* easydict
* sklearn

## Dataset:

You need to modify the path of the image in every ".txt" in "./data".

## Training:

You can run "./scripts/train.sh" to train and evaluate on the task. Before that, you need to change the project root, dataset (Office-Home or Office-31), data address and CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES in the script.
